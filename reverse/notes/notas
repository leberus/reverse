The observant reader may ask why are 8 bytes allocated for int values, when 4 is enough?  Yes, one has to remember: 
8 bytes are allocated for any data type shorter than 64 bits. This is established for the convenienceâ€™s sake: it makes it easy to calculate the address of arbitrary argument.  Besides, they are all located at aligned memory addresses.  Itis the same in the 32-bit environments: 4 bytes are reserved for all data types
